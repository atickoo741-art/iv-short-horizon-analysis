# Short-Horizon Analysis of Implied Volatility in 1-DTE Equity Options

This repository documents a personal statistical research project exploring the short-horizon behavior of implied volatility in one-day-to-expiration (1-DTE) equity options.

# Overview
The project investigates whether short-dated implied volatility exhibits structure beyond simple persistence assumptions over intraday intervals. The focus is on empirical analysis and statistical evaluation rather than trading performance.

# Methodology
- Collected short-dated equity option chain data at regular intraday intervals
- Computed implied volatility metrics for near-the-money contracts
- Evaluated short-horizon changes relative to a naïve persistence baseline
- Analyzed behavior across different market conditions
